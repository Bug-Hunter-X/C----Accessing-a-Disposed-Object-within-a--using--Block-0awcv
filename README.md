# C# - Accessing a Disposed Object within a 'using' Block

This example demonstrates a common error in C#: accessing a disposed object after it's been released by a `using` statement.  The `MyDbContext` represents a database context, or any other disposable resource. The problem occurs when `MyMethod()` tries to access `context` after it has already been disposed of at the end of the `using` block. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or crashes.

The solution shows how to properly manage the object's lifecycle to prevent this issue.  Solutions usually involve refactoring code to use the object within the scope of the `using` statement, or by creating a local copy if data persistence beyond the using block is necessary.
